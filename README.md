This project utilizes large amounts of raw text data provided by SwiftKey to build a predictive text algorithm. 

The app is hosted via Shinyapps.io: https://glakin.shinyapps.io/text_prediction_app/

A second app utilizing the same strategy to predict Shakespearean is also hosted on Shinyapps.io here: https://glakin.shinyapps.io/shakespeare_text_prediction_app/

The data was downloaded through Coursera: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

A report detailing initial data exploration can be found in RPubs: https://rpubs.com/glakin/827608
